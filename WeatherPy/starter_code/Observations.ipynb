    "* The average distribution of dots in the latitude ranges between 0 to 20 and -20, 0 to 40 and -40, 0 to 60 and -60,  is of similar proportions, indicating that as you get closer to the equator, the temperature rises. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Wind, cloudiness, and humidity had a constant, similar amount of phenomena across the entire latitude, not making the equator influential, therefore, not correlated. \n",
